# Components (coming soon!)

Currently all of the custom components in strudel-kit are included in the base template in `src/components`. We are working to release these components as an independent package so they can be implemented into existing React apps. Check back soon for more details and documentation!

If you have ideas for components or are interested in contributing, let us know by posting in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/strudel-science/discussions/) page.
