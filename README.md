# STRUDEL Kit

STRUDEL Kit is a React and TypeScript-based starter kit for building scientific UIs based on the STRUDEL Design System and Task Flows. Visit [strudel.science](https://strudel.science) for more information about the STRUDEL project.

This library provides a suite of templates to implement UIs for various different task flows common to the scientific domain. The app is intended to be used as a starting point for building out a modern single-page web app for scientific-type UIs.
